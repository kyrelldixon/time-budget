# Time Budgetting App Prototype

> The time tracking app for people who hate scheduling

The goal of this app is to help me spend my time more intentionally.

It's easy to go through the day doing things that you want to do, but finding the time to do what you need to do *and* what you want to do can be difficult.

This app aims to solve that problem.

Overall flow:

1. Create a time budget based on how you want to spend your time
2. Start a timer before you do an activity
3. Stop it when you're done

## Features

* Time budget by activity
* Time tracking

## Set up

Install it and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev
```
